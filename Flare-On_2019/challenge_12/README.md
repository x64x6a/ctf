I spent about a week on this challenge before I decided to guess the beginning of the key. 

Part of the key can be found in unicode strings and I guessed the rest.
`follow_th3_br34dcrumbs@flare-on.com`


I spent the week doing various things including  extracting a keypass database and dummbly trying to brute force it and debugging the memory dump partway.  I've included a few binaries I found.  I'm not sure how far I got to properly solving the challenge as I will need to read the official writeup.

There's numerous other things I discovered, but I don't feel the need to completely document them here as I didn't use them to solve the challenge.
